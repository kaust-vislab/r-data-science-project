## Creating a new project from this template

Simply follow the [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create a new project repository from this template.

## Project organization

Repository containing scaffolding for a language agnostic data science project. Project organization is based on ideas from [_Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing_](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
2. Put external scripts or compiled programs in the `bin` directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in a `data` directory.
4. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.
5. Put all Docker related files in the `docker` directory.
6. Put files generated during cleanup and analysis in a `results` directory.
7. Put project source code in the `src` directory.
8. Name all files to reflect their content or function.
